In fact, many genomes assemble today thousands of genomes each year. Are not assembled into single circle of strength as in the case of bacterial genome but instead as split into multiply contigs. Let me explain why it is happening. The previously described how to move from reads to de Burijn Graph of Genome and finally to Genome as a pass, Eulerian path in this graph. But in reality, even in this simple graph, there are multiply Eulerian paths. For example, here's one Eulerian path, and here's another Eulerian path. Of each of this multiply Eulerian paths corresponds to a real journey And often biologists don't have a possibility of using modern sickness and technologies to answer this question, at least to answer it on limited budget. And that's why they break genome into contigs, they note that there's known branching pathogens in this graph, correspond segments of each possible Eulerian path, and as a result they break the paragraph into the following context. Corresponding there's a following strain and this is often, output, as the solution of genome sickness and problem. It is an imperfect solution, but that's what we want you to do. to output contigs that belong to all possible, Eulerian path in the constructed de Bruijn graph. And contig generation problem will be given a set of k-mer patterns, generate all contigs in the graph, devoid of patterns [MUSIC]
